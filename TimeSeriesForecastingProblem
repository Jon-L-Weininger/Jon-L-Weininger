Overview

Business value: 
- forecasting my gas bill will help me anticipate future scenarios and take corrective action if needed
- potential to more effectively meet my monthly budget if I can anticipate future gas bills
- avoid surprises in monthly budget when gas bill is higher than average due to seasonality

Desired outcomes: 
- develop a time series forecast (prediction) quickly in the various tools and platforms available
- compare speed, ease of use, and repeatability across tools
  - consider BigQuery ML
  - consider Google autoML (like autoML tables)
  - consider Python packages for traditional statistical forecasting statsmodels 
      and more recent packages focused on ML approaches (like LSTM in the RNN family)
        example: https://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-prediction-lstm-recurrent-neural-networks-python-keras/
  - consider Excel's "forecast sheet" concept to develop the fastest scrappy baseline forecast possible
    -explore additional timeseries forecasting approaches/functions in excel, if any exist


Learned: PARSE_DATETIME in BigQuery to deal with CSV data format from input file.
